## React Native
I would really dive into the mobile app creation world.
## Next.js
I understand the basics, but it's a powerfull framework to combine with React and I want to master SSR.
## No SQL databases
I'm really really curious about MongoDB. I'm a postgreSQL stan but I'm interested.
## Cloud fundamentals
I would love to deep dive into AWS, Azure and understand perfectly CI/CD.
## Vue.js
Really looking forward to master other frontend modern frameworks.
